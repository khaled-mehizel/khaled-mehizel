### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Khaled, a data analyst!
I started my journey with data as many people do, with Excel. During my learning journey with Excel, I heard of this reporting tool called Power BI! And that's how I started, yes I learned Power BI before SQL. The more projects, and the more I learned, the more certain I am that data analytics is something I would love very much to do in my life.

### Here's me in a few bullet points
- Excel, SQL, Power BI, Python, Tableau
- Looking for work in Cracow, Poland
- Computer geek, car geek, video game enjoyer, bookworm, powerlifter
- Like punk, classic rock, jazz, hip hop, trance, eurobeat, Jungle DnB
